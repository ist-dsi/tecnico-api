  summary: Fetch enrolled courses
  description: |
    Fetch enrolled courses of the logged in student, including the student's grade and course's ECTS count.
    Note that "enrolled courses" are the ones where the student is able to get a grade.

    If the user is not a student, an empty list is returned.  
    Optionally, a year and semester can be passed to get the enrolments in that specific year (and semester).
    If left empty, the current semester will be used.

    The following logic will be used to decide which semesters to include in the response:
      - if both year and semester are given, it includes only that semester of that year
      - if only the year is given, it includes both semesters of that year
      - if only the semester is given, it includes that semester of the current year
      - if neither the year nor semester are given, it includes the current semester of the current year

    Requires the `read:student` scope.
