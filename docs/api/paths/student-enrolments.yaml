get:
  description: |
    Fetch enroled courses of the logged in student, including the student's grade and course's ECTS count.
    Requires the `read:student` scope.
    If the user is not a student, an empty list is returned.
    Optionally, a year and semester can be passed to get the enrolments in that sepecific year (and semester).
    If left empty, the current semester will be used.

    The following logic will be used to decide which semesters to include in the response:
      - if both year and semester are given, it returns only that semester of that year
      - if only the year is given, it returns both semesters of that year
      - if only the semester is given, it returns that semester of the current year
      - if neither the year nor semester are given, it returns the current semester of the current year
